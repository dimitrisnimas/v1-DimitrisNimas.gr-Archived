# Old Personal Website (Archived v1)

This repository contains the source code for my archived personal website, built using pure HTML and CSS.  
The site is no longer in use or maintained — it's here for reference and archival purposes only.

## 📁 What's Inside

- `index.html` — Main homepage
- Additional `.html` files
- `css/` — Stylesheets
- `assets/` — Images, fonts, or other media

## 💡 Notes

- This project does not use any frameworks but uses JavaScript.
- Feel free to explore the code or use it as a starting point for your own site.
- No active updates or support.

## 📄 License

This code is shared for reference only.
